## EdTech Recorded Lectures Analysis  

### 📊 Project Overview  

I recently completed an insightful data analysis project focused on recorded lectures in the EdTech sector. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle (8,092 rows, 44 columns), I performed comprehensive data cleaning—removing duplicates, blank rows, errors, and unnecessary columns—to ensure accurate insights. The primary emphasis of this analysis was on CATEGORY trends, helping EdTech businesses optimize their course offerings.  

#### 🔹 Key Insights Delivered  

✅ Distribution of course types across categories and sub-categories to identify high-demand areas.  

✅ Average number of views by category, sub-category, and language, revealing viewer engagement patterns.  

✅ Top skills taught in each category to align with current job market demands.  

✅ Language distribution and viewer preferences for the top 5 categories.  

✅ Impact of subtitles on viewership and accessibility.  

✅ Relationship between course duration and average views.  

✅ Top-rated instructors by category and sub-category.  

### 💡 Business Impact  

This dashboard empowers EdTech platforms to make data-driven decisions, enhancing both content relevance and audience engagement. By identifying popular categories, preferred languages, and effective course structures, businesses can tailor their course offerings to meet the evolving needs of learners.
